<!--
        The style sheet was not required;
        however, I used AI to make the survey look
        prettier. Apparently CSS was the best
        way of doing so, but I hardly like
        working with it.

        NOTE: The prompt was very generic, so
        although I forgot to include it - it was
        essentially just "Here is code for a
        survey. Make it centered, uniformly styled,
        and readable."

        I don't suggest modifying any of this,

        the underlying JS code.

        changed this to continue because
        I realized "next question"
        doesn't really make sense for non-task
        survey items.

        Considering moving these to a better, more
        localized spot.
