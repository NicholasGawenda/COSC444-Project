Stefaniak, J. E., & Turkelson, C. L. (2014). Does the sequence of instruction matter during simulation?Simulation in Healthcare: Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare, 9(1), 15-20. doi:10.1097/SIH.0b013e3182a8336f

Found that the sequencing of materials (lecture and simulation environment) impacted the overall understanding of the subject matter. Simulation and then lecture performed better than lecture than simulation. Suggests that knowledge acquisition is not just exposure to knowledge, but the order of instruction (OOI) impacts it too.

Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education, United States of America, pp. 3123-3129

Did not find any impact from OOI. Experimented with the ordering of visualization or explanation first

Found that the sequencing of examples and problems had a strong impact on the understanding of the material. E being example and P being problem. EEEE and EPEP had the largest impact on knowledge acquisition.

"For classroom learners, it may not matter if the default past marker is perfective or imperfective; whichever is taught first would likely be the default past tense marker"
